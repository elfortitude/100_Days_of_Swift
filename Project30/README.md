#  Project 30

The thirtieth project iOS developing project in "100 days of Swift" challenge on website: www.hackingwithswift.com

This is a technique project and we learned how to profiling code in Swift and use Instruments (application for tracking the behavior of programs by Apple). We practiced and learned about using the Time Profiler and Allocations instruments, how to draw shadows in both Core Graphics and CALayer, re-using table view cells in code and fixing running out of memory.
