#  Project 19

The nineteenth iOS developing project in "100 days of Swift" challenge on website: www.hackingwithswift.com

In this project we created simple Extension for Safari browser app using NSExtensionItem, UITextView, NotificationCenter and UserDefaults.

The essence of our extension app is as follows: this is a Safari extension, which lets us embed a version of our app directly inside Safari's action menu, then manipulate Safari data in interesting ways. User can insert custom JavaScript code in Text View inside our extension. Then weâ€™re going to send custom JavaScript code back to Safari and have it executed, giving our users the ability to manipulate web pages right on their phone.

## Demonstration

Our Extension is inside the Safari's Action menu.
