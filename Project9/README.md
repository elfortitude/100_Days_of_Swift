#  Project 9

In this technical project we learned about multitasking, Grand Central Dispatch and QoS (Quality of Service). We added this functional in [Project 7](https://github.com/elfortitude/100_Days_of_Swift/tree/main/Project7). Code in this directory contains only GCD, but we practice also performSelector(). Also like homework we add multithreading in [Project 1](https://github.com/elfortitude/100_Days_of_Swift/tree/main/Project1) and [Project 8](https://github.com/elfortitude/100_Days_of_Swift/tree/main/Project8), but it isn't published. Just belive me;)

My solutions with GCD and multithreading in this project is not perfectly, but it's only first step. Do not judge strictly üôè
