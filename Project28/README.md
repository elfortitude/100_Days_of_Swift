#  Project 28

The twenty-eighth project iOS developing project in "100 days of Swift" challenge on website: www.hackingwithswift.com

In this project we created simple secure text editor with biometry (FaceID/TouchID) or passcode access. Also we store notes and passcode system in Keychain - secure encrypted space for our app. We practiced and learned about the LocalAuthentication framework and the iOS keychain.
