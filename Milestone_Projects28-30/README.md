# Milestone: Projects 28-30

Unaided iOS developing project in "100 days of Swift" challenge on website: www.hackingwithswift.com

This is last project of 100 days of Swift challenge. And in this project we created a simple memory pairs game that has players find pairs of cards – it’s sometimes called Concentration, Pelmanism, or Pairs for iPad with using UIKit. We remember how to work with UIImage, UIView.transition, constraints in code, engineering game script and reload game.
