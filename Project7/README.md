#  Project 7

In this project we created simple viewer of petitions with tabs and ability to view each petitions and its description. We learned UITabBarController, Codable, Data, JSON parsing and UIStoryboard (creating views in code). The filtering function is also implemented.

All data taken through the White House API.

## Demonstration

List of petitions with titles and subtitles (part of description):
